        <h2>What other famous people say about Freddie:</h2>
        <div>
          <div class="box">
          <p>I adored Freddie Mercury and Queen had a hit with Radio Ga Ga. That's why I love the name. Freddie was unique, one of the biggest personalities in pop music. He was not only a singer but also a fantastic performer, a man of theatre and someone who constantly transformed himself. In short, a genius. It's all about him and David Bowie.</p>
          <p>--Lady Gaga</p>
      </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="box">
          <p>Of all the more theatrical performers, Freddie took it further than the rest. He took it over the edge. And of course I always admire a man who wears tights!</p>
          <p>--David Bowie</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="box">
          <p>I used to take a nap in the van and listen to Queen. Over and over again and drain the battery on the van. Then we'd be stuck. That happened a few times. We'd be stuck with a dead battery because I'd listened to Queen too much.</p>
          <p>--Kurt Cobain (reflecting on his dad taking him on father and son days out)</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="box">
          <p>Freddie is a real one off and at that time nobody looked like him, sang like him with the harmonies and everything.</p>
          <p>--Elton John</p>

          <p>[...] Freddie Mercury, an extraordinary rock star who rushed across our cultural landscape like a comet shooting across the sky. [...] The bright light of his talent exhilarates us even now that his life has been so cruelly extinguished it needn't have happened, it shouldn't have happened. Please let's not [let] it happen again.</p>
          <p>--Elizabeth Taylor</p>
